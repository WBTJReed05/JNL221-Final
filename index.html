  <p>The cost of tuition is a prevalent issue among college students, with many dependent on financial aid to ease the burden. Despite the multitude of scholarships and programs dedicated to assisting students in the betterment of their education, smaller, state-specific programs sometimes go under the radar for those not searching in the right places.</p>  
  <p>One such program is the New York State Tuition Assistance Program, which, for the last five decades, has provided students from New York with a small shield against their tuition costs.</p>
  <p>The New York State Tuition Assistance Program, or NYS TAP for short, is a need-based grant that provides between five hundred and five thousand dollars of annual awards for New York State residents. For attendees of SUNYs or CUNYs, this can cover a significant chunk of tuition expenses without requiring students to pay it back.</p>
  <p>Beginning in 1974 as a replacement for the Regents Scholarship award, the NYS TAP was established to maximize access to higher education for all qualified students, providing upwards of $1500 of relief.</p>
  <p>From there, the award would gradually increase every few years to maintain pace with the rising tuition costs at SUNYs and CUNYs, respectively, peaking at over $4000 during the 1990-1991 school year. </p>
  <p>The TAP’s maximum award for Financially Dependent Undergrads would hover around that figure for the next decade. As time progressed, the cost of tuition at schools would continue to expand, with the TAP ultimately maxing out at $5000 by the year 2000.</p>

  <p>As convenient as the NYS TAP is for providing aid to students, the money pit isn’t limitless. As a result, it prioritizes extra assistance during the initial two years of a student’s college career, as they’re under a full-time TAP schedule.</p>
  <p> Once those two years are up, students are placed on a reduced schedule and receive less funding, though the minimum payout remains at $500. </p>
  <p>The TAP is also based primarily on family income, with higher awards given to those from less affluent backgrounds. Because the TAP specializes in helping students achieve a college education, those taking at least 12 credits during a semester qualify as “Full-Time Equivalents” or FTEs, meaning they receive more help than part-time students.</p>
  <p>While yearly average payouts by the TAP remained healthy entering the 2010s, its effectiveness in helping students was severely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

  <p>From 2019 to 2020, the course of just one year, the TAP’s average spending decreased by roughly 63% due to increased federal spending on handling the pandemic. </p>

  <p>With that, a combination of further payment and processing delays, as well as dropping enrollment rates, continued to hurt the TAP's efficiency during this time, limiting its spending potential. </p>

  <p>Today, the TAP is slowly recovering, with 2023’s figures up over 10% from the lows of COVID, though it’s still a far cry from its peak spending in 2018. </p>
  <p>Though the NYS TAP isn’t quite as effective as it once was, it’s still a valuable asset that provides students the opportunity to attend colleges at a discounted price, however big or small that may be.</p>
